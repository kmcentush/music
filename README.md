# python-project-template
Template for a Python project.

To get started after after cloning:
- Rename `src/package_root` -> `src/<package_name>`
- `pyproject.toml`: replace all `PLACEHOLDER`; there are five
- `Makefile`: replace all `PLACEHOLDER`; there are two

Version bumping:
- Edit `__version__` in `src/<package_name>/__init__.py`
